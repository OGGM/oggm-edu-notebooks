    "- There are two different types of melt models: the energy balance model and the temperature index model\n",
    "- The temperature index model is the computationally efficient simplification of the energy balance model\n",
    "- Temperature index models assume an empirical relationship between air temperature and melt rates\n",
    "- Temperature index models can be extended to model glacier mass balance by adding solid precipitation as a model parameter\n",
    "- The model outcome is significantly influenced by the choice of $T_{Melt}$ and $T_{Solid}$\n",
    "- The temperature sensitivity of a glacier is not constant in time $\\mu^* = \\mu^*(t)$\n",
    "- The specific mass balance is a function of the climate and the glacier surface area"
