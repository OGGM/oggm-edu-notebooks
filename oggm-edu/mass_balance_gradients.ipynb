    "Compare the response times. From our results we can only discuss this qualitatively. Glaciers with small MBG need more time to adjust to climate changes than glaciers with high MBGs (under the condition that the changes are similar). Glaciers with gradients as high as the third model need only a few years to adjust to the climate (compare Franz Josef glacier in New Zealand[⁶](#References)).[⁷](#References) The response time of glaciers with low gradients is in reality much higher than 200 years, actually around 2000 years.  In general, we have to consider that the response time depends also on other features like the glacier-type,  size, bed slope and average surface elevation.[⁴](#References)"
