    "Unlike for Hintereisferner, these projections indicate that the annual runoff will increase in all the scenarios for the first half of the century. The higher RCP scenarios can reach **peak water** later in the century, since the excess melt can continue to increase. For the lower RCP scenarios on the other hand, the glacier might be approaching a new equilibirum, which reduces the runoff earlier in the century ([Rounce et. al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00331/full)). After **peak water** is reached (RCP2.6: ~2055, RCP8.5: ~2070 in these projections), the annual runoff begins to decrease. This decrease occurs because the shrinking glacier is no longer able to support the high levels of melt."
