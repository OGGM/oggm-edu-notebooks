    "OGGM employs what is known as a flowline model to simulate the evolution of glaciers. What this means is that the model represents the glacier as a group of lines along which the ice flows down the mountain. The flowlines connect on to, or branch off, each other forming a system along which the ice flows. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the model the flowlines are divided into finite boxes, each containing a part of the ice that makes up the glacier. The size of a box depends on how wide and deep the glacier is at the location. The model then calculates how much ice flows in to the box from boxes above and how much ice that leaves the box and goes into boxes below.\n",
